Dotfiles
========

This is intended to be a default configuration of dotfiles for my own development purposes. YMMV.

the dotfiles directory should be placed in ~. symbolic links from ~/.gitignore_global, ~/.gitconfig, ~/.bashrc, ~/.bash_profile, and ~/.ssh/config should be made to their respective counterparts in the dotfiles project directory.
